Reporting a Vulnerability
Due to the nature of this tool's utilization in research, analysis, and operational security workflows, any vulnerabilities or weaknesses discovered should be reported directly and responsibly.

If you believe you have found a security issue, please do not open a public issue. Instead, contact the maintainer privately:

Email: iassistuontoolkits@gmail.com

Your report will be reviewed promptly and handled with strict confidentiality. Please include as much detail as possible in your report to help with verification and remediation.

We appreciate your responsible disclosure and commitment to improving the security of this project.
